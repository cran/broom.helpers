#' Add the (weighted) number of observations
#'
#' Add the number of observations in a new column `n_obs`, taking into account any
#' weights if they have been defined.
#'
#' For continuous variables, it corresponds to all valid observations
#' contributing to the model.
#'
#' For categorical variables coded with treatment or sum contrasts,
#' each model term could be associated to only one level of the original
#' categorical variable. Therefore, `n_obs` will correspond to the number of
#' observations associated with that level. `n_obs` will also be computed for
#' reference rows. For polynomial contrasts (defined with [stats::contr.poly()]),
#' all levels will contribute to the computation of each model term. Therefore,
#' `n_obs` will be equal to the total number of observations. For Helmert and custom
#' contrasts, only rows contributing positively (i.e. with a positive contrast)
#' to the computation of a term will be considered for estimating `n_obs`. The
#' result could therefore be difficult to interpret. For a better understanding
#' of which observations are taken into account to compute `n_obs` values, you
#' could look at [model_compute_terms_contributions()].
#'
#' For interaction terms, only rows contributing to all the terms of the
#' interaction will be considered to compute `n_obs`.
#'
#' For binomial logistic models, `tidy_add_n()` will also return the
#' corresponding number of events (`n_event`) for each term, taking into account
#' any defined weights. Observed proportions could be obtained as `n_obs / n_event`.
#'
#' Similarly, a number of events will be computed for multinomial logistic
#' models ([nnet::multinom()]) for each level of the outcome (`y.level`),
#' corresponding to the number of observations equal to that outcome level.
#'
#' For Poisson models, `n_event` will be equal to the number of counts per term.
#' In addition, a third column `exposure` will be computed. If no offset is
#' defined, exposure is assumed to be equal to 1 (eventually multiplied by
#' weights) per observation. If an offset is defined, `exposure` will be equal
#' to the (weighted) sum of the exponential of the offset (as a reminder, to
#' model the effect of `x` on the ratio `y / z`, a Poisson model will be defined
#' as `glm(y ~ x + offset(log(z)), family = poisson)`). Observed rates could be
#' obtained with `n_event / exposure`.
#'
#' For Cox models ([survival::coxph()]), an individual could be coded
#' with several observations (several rows). `n_obs` will correspond to the weighted
#' number of observations which could be different from the number of
#' individuals. `tidy_add_n()` will also compute a (weighted) number of events
#' (`n_event`) according to the definition of the [survival::Surv()] object.
#' Exposure time is also returned in `exposure` column. It is equal to the
#' (weighted) sum of the time variable if only one variable time is passed to
#' [survival::Surv()], and to the (weighted) sum of `time2 - time` if two time
#' variables are defined in [survival::Surv()].
#'
#' For competing risk regression models ([tidycmprsk::crr()]), `n_event` takes
#' into account only the event of interest defined by `failcode.`
#'
#' The (weighted) total number of observations (`N_obs`), of events (`N_event`) and
#' of exposure time (`Exposure`) are stored as attributes of the returned
#' tibble.
